# Installation of Python
- Open a command prompt
- Type `python`
- If you get some text and `>>>` verify the text above says `Python 3.7.4` or later.  Type `exit()` to return to a command prompt.
- If nothing comes back, then another window to the Windows Store should open to the python page
- Install python from the Windows store
- Once installed type `python --version` to get the current version of Python, which should be `Python 3.7.4` or later

This is an optional step, will making updating the files a bit easier, but if you don't want to deal with it, you can always just download the .zip file from the main page
