# CMN_File_Manipulation
A collection of scripts for file manipulation for CMN csv files.

This was written assuming the use of Windows 10 with current updates as of 8-Sept-2019

This was also written to use as much of the standard library as possible to minimze the need to install packages.

These were also written in such a was as for a non-software developer to be able to understand them troubleshoot them if necessary.

# Installation of Python
- Open a command prompt
- Type `python`
- If you get some text and `>>>` verify the text above says `Python 3.7.4` or later.  Type `exit()` to return to a command prompt.
- If nothing comes back, then another window to the Windows Store should open to the python page
- Install python from the Windows store
- Once installed type `python --version` to get the current version of Python, which should be `Python 3.7.4` or later

# Install Git for Windows
This is an optional step, will making updating the files a bit easier, but if you don't want to deal with it, you can always just download the .zip file from the main page

https://git-scm.com/downloads

# Cloning the repo
If managing zip files isn't your thing, this will be a bit easier with a few commands

- Pick a folder to be your working directory, for example `c:\Users\<loginid>\`
- Type `git clone https://github.com/joej164/CMN_File_Manipulation.git` to copy the files to your PC
- You should now have a folder named `CMN_File_Manipulation` in that directory

# Verify everything is working
Lets make sure you can run a basic program
