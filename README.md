# CMN_File_Manipulation
A collection of scripts for file manipulation for CMN csv files.

This was written assuming the use of Windows 10 with current updates as of 8-Sept-2019

This was also written to use as much of the standard library as possible to minimze the need to install packages.

These were also written in such a was as for a non-software developer to be able to understand them troubleshoot them if necessary.


# Running specific scripts
I'll expand this as they get written.

I think I'll break the getting started into a seperate README file as well

Please review, based on what I've heard you need, 

- Merge multiple `csv` files into a single master file
- Combine users who contributed multiple times into a single entry with a total amount of money contributed
- Determine the number of tickets each user gets
- Randomly select X number of tickets from the pool of total tickets
- Create a csv with winners and addresses to mail the prizes to

Each of the items I see as a seperate script.  I could write a large program, but initialy i'm thinking a bunch of small scripts would be easier for you to use and comprehend.  I could be wrong also..
